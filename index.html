  <p>For ESO players</p>
  <p>Who is having trouble figuring out what to do at the end game in ESO.</p>
  <p><b>ESO Essentials</b></p>
  <p>Is a website that will easily explain and visually show ESO players what activities they should be doing when they hit the end game.</p>
  <p>Unlike the Unofficial ESO Page https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Online</p>
  <p>Our product will be much simpler and only loaded with ESO End Game in mind.</p>
